title: "Burst amplitude is affected by speaking rate: Cross-linguistic observations and implications"
abstract: >
  The relationship between speaking rate and burst amplitude in voiceless
  plosives was investigated in two languages with differing oro-laryngeal
  timing relationships for voicing, North American English and Indian Tamil.
  Burst amplitude was hypothesized to decrease in CV syllables with increasing
  speaking rate, as there is decreased time for intraoral pressure buildup
  behind the oral occlusion. In a production experiment increased speaking rate
  led to decreased burst amplitude (relative to vowel amplitude) in the F2/F3
  range and above 3kHz. While the general effect was found in both languages,
  it was most pronounced in English, owing to its short-lag oro-laryngeal
  timing configuration. Implications for speech perception and sound change are
  discussed.
