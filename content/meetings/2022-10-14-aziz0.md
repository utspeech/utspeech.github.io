abstract: >
    Vowel devoicing has been variably described as a purely phonetic (e.g., Jun
    et al., 1997) or phonological (e.g,, Tanner et al., 2019) process. In this
    work, I look at devoicing data from a dialect of Malagasy (Austronesian,
    Madagascar) and find that it is accurately modelled using a version of
    Articulatory Phonology (Browman & Goldstein, 1986) couched in Optimality
    Theory (Gafos, 2002; Hall 2003). By considering phonological alignment
    constraints as well as the inherent phonetic properties of Malagasy
    segments, I am able to account for the variation in devoicing observed in
    Malagasy. This result shows that vowel devoicing is not necessarily purely
    phonetic or phonological, but can be a result of multiple factors from
    within and beyond the phonological grammar.
