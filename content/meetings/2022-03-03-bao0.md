abstract: >
  Bilinguals outperform monolinguals on various cognitive tasks, which is often
  interpreted as a bilingual advantage. Primarily based on findings from
  (audio-)visual attention tasks, it is hypothesized that this between-group
  difference might stem from their different attention allocation strategies.
  Yet, little is known about whether such distinction exists in the auditory
  domain alone, despite the importance of auditory attention to early language
  development. In this talk, I will present a systematic review and
  meta-analysis that assess if there are reliable differences between
  monolingual and bilingual children across typically/atypically developing
  populations in auditory attention, as measured by standardized tests. A
  comprehensive literature search was conducted in three electronic databases:
  OVID Medline, OVID PsycInfo and EBSCO CINAHL. Only empirical studies
  reporting standardized measures of auditory attention in monolingual and
  bilingual participants below 18 years were included. Results suggest little
  difference between the two groups in their performance on standardized
  auditory attention tests. Whether the lack of "bilingual advantage" observed
  here is related to the potentially wide variety of bilingual children
  included across studies and/or the standardized tests being developed for
  monolingual English-speaking populations only will be discussed.
