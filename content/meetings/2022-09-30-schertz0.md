  The role of prevoicing in word-initial phonologically "voiced" stops
  /b d g/ differs across languages. In "true voicing" languages like Spanish,
  prevoicing is obligatory, and is assumed to be the primary cue
  differentiating these sounds from their voiceless counterparts. In English,
  prevoicing is in free variation, optional but not obligatory. In Mandarin,
  prevoicing is never present. My current work examines how language
  background affects perceptual sensitivity to, and ability to imitate,
  minimal differences in the presence vs. absence of prevoicing across native
  and heritage speakers of these three types of languages.
