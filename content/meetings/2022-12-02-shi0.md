abstract: >
    Voice Assistants in Vehicles has been a popular application of dialogue
    systems, and there have been many different approaches for this task. This
    talk will briefly present an evaluation of three models: a domain-specific
    one based upon typed feature structures, a neural language model, and a
    mixture of the two, on an unseen but in-domain corpus of user queries in
    the context of a dialogue classification task. The finding opens the door
    to a potentially new application of neural language models. The study has
    changed our perspective on the potential role of structured representations 
    in the future of dialogue systems, and suggests that formal research in
    this area may have a new role to play in validating and coordinating ad
    hoc dialogue systems development.
