  This presentation will discuss the preliminary results of two experiments on
  voice recognition.  The first uses time-reversed speech to see if the
  Language Familiarity Effect (LFE) is sensitive to top-down processing of
  language group, while the second experiment uses a sentence recognition
  demasking paradigm to address questions about voice recognition across
  different native dialects of the same language. The Language Familiarity
  Effect (LFE), in which listeners are better at recognizing voices in their
  native language compared to languages in which they do not have fluency (e.g.
  Thompson, 1987, Goggin et al., 1991) seems to be driven by familiarity with
  the phonology of the language (e.g. Fleming et al., 2014; Johnson et al.,
  2018; Lember 2015).  However, listeners' perception of various phonological
  features can shift dependant on the listeners' belief about the talker's
  group identity. Some examples of vowel perception shifting include when
  listeners were made to believe the same talkers were alternatively male or
  female (Strand & Johnson, 1996) or of either Australian or New Zealand
  descent (Hay & Drager, 2010).  What would happen if such shifts of perception
  were done with voice recognition in the context of the LFE?  Preliminary
  results looking at the effect of top-down in-group processing on the
  recognition of Dutch and English voices will be presented.   Speech was
  time-reversed so as to mask the language and English-speaking participants
  were either told the truth or lied to about the language they were hearing.
  Another area of voice recognition research has focused on the effect of
  dialect.  Vanags et al. (2005) looking at Australian vs British English
  talkers and Kerstholt et al. (2006) with talkers of Standard Dutch vs Dutch
  from The Hague have found both found an effect of own-accent bias in voice
  recognition.  However, both studies were unidirectional, with participants
  from only one of the two accent groups.  In comparison, Johnson et al. (2018)
  found no own-accent bias among either Canadian or Australian participants
  when presented with both Canadian and Australian English talkers.  To explain
  these results, the authors suggested at the time that listeners must be able
  to access a level of abstract phonological processing in during voice
  recognition.  Presented in this talk are results from a sentence demasking
  task in which the same stimuli used in Johnson et al. (2018) was presented to
  listeners in progressively less amounts of noise.  Preliminary results of
  this experiment show that Canadian listeners are not as good at recognizing
  sentences produced by the Australian talkers as those produced by the
  Canadian talkers when they are embedded in noise.  This undermines the idea
  that Canadian listeners can access an abstracted level of phonology with
  equal accuracy when listening to both sets of voices.  Suggestions for how to
  interpret these results with Johnson et al. (2018)'s findings and the planned
  next experiment to further explore this issue will be discussed.
