# Welcome

The University of Toronto Speech Group is a presentation venue for researchers
working on speech. We bring together speech-language pathology, computational
linguistics, phonetics, phonology, and psychology. We welcome members and
presenters from all three campuses as well as external presenters.

The group is administered by [Ewan
Dunbar](http://individual.utoronto.ca/ewan_dunbar/), [Vanina Machado
Araujo](https://www.spanport.utoronto.ca/people/directories/graduate-students/vanina-machado),
and [Sean Robertson](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~sdrobert).
