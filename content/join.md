## Online

On top of posts to this site, meeting information will be distributed through
our mailing list. We will also distribute [Zoom](https://zoom.us/) links and
passcodes through the mailing list for online attendance of meetings.

To join the mailing list, send an email to {{<cloakemail
"speechut-l@listserv.utoronto.ca">}}. The request to join will be reviewed by
one of the members of the team.

## In-person

Those interested in attending meetings in-person may simply show up at **Room
213 in Odette Hall**.

While we prefer presenters to present in-person, sometimes this will not be
possible. In those cases the presentation will be primarily online through
Zoom. Members may still come to Odette Hall to watch the Zoom meeting together
and discuss.
