Jake is a Ph.D. Candidate at UCLA who works on all things phonology and all
things Malagasy. He is particularly interested in studying interfaces to answer
questions about phonology, looking at both the intersection of phonetics and
phonology and syntax and phonology, looking at the correspondence between
syntactic and prosodic phrases in Malagasy. His work is the result of long-term
collaboration with members of the Malagasy-Canadian community in Montreal, to
whom he is immensely grateful!
