title: Children's language attitudes and media
affiliation: Psychology
abstract: >
  Throughout their daily lives, listeners routinely make inferences about
  others based on how they speak (e.g., their age, gender, SES, etc.). In many
  cases, these linguistic inferences are accompanied by social evaluations of
  speakers (e.g., how intelligent, friendly, confident they sound). My work
  explores the development of children's linguistic biases, looking
  specifically at children's evaluations of foreign-accented speakers. I will
  present work showing that children's language biases-rather than decrease as
  they get older-actually increase, as well as ongoing work looking at the
  possible role of media in both shaping children's language attitudes and
  mitigating linguistic biases.
